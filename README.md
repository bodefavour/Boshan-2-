# Boshan E-commerce Project

## Overview
This project is a React-based e-commerce application. It showcases a product listing page with filtering and sorting functionalities.

## File Descriptions

### Root Directory
-   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
    -   `dependencies`: Lists libraries required for the application to run (e.g., `react`, `tailwindcss`).
    -   `devDependencies`: Lists tools used during development (e.g., `@types/node`, `tsx`).
    -   `scripts`: Defines commands for common tasks like starting the development server (`start`), building the project (`build`), and running tests (`test`).
-   **`package-lock.json`**: Records the exact versions of dependencies used, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.
-   **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler, specifying how TypeScript code should be transpiled to JavaScript.
-   **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, allowing customization of utility classes, themes, and plugins.
-   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts).
-   **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and documentation for the project.

### `public/` Directory
This directory contains static assets that are served directly by the web server.
-   **`index.html`**: The main HTML page that serves as the entry point for the React application. The React components are injected into the `<div id="root"></div>` element within this file.
-   **`favicon.ico`**: The icon displayed in the browser tab.
-   **`logo192.png` & `logo512.png`**: App icons of different sizes, typically used for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and mobile home screen icons.
-   **`manifest.json`**: Provides metadata for the web application, used when the app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop (PWA feature).
-   **`robots.txt`**: Provides instructions to web crawlers about which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site.

### `src/` Directory
This directory contains the source code of the React application.
-   **`index.tsx`**: The main entry point for the React application's JavaScript code. It typically renders the root `App` component into the DOM.
-   **`App.tsx`**: The main application component, which usually sets up routing and the overall layout of the application.
-   **`reportWebVitals.ts`**: A utility for measuring performance metrics in the application.
-   **`setupTests.ts`**: Configuration file for setting up testing environments, often used with Jest.
-   **`heroicons-react-outline.d.ts`**: A TypeScript declaration file for the `@heroicons/react/outline` module. It provides type information for the Heroicons components, enabling better autocompletion and type checking when using these icons in TypeScript.

#### `src/components/` Directory
Contains reusable UI components.
-   **`Header.tsx`**: Component for the website's header/navigation bar.
-   **`ProductCard.tsx`**: Component to display individual product information in a card format.
-   **`ProductFilter.tsx`**: Component that provides UI elements for filtering and sorting products (e.g., by price range, sort order).
-   **`ProductGrid.tsx`**: Component responsible for fetching and displaying a grid of products. It likely uses `ProductCard` for each product and integrates with `ProductFilter` to update the displayed products based on user selections.
-   **`Footer.tsx`**: Component for the website's footer.
-   **`Banner.tsx`**: Component for displaying promotional banners.
-   **`Cart.tsx`**: Component for the shopping cart functionality.
-   **`Checkout.tsx`**: Component for the checkout process.
-   **`ProductDetail.tsx`**: Component to display detailed information about a single product.

#### `src/assets/` Directory
Contains static assets like images used within the application components.
-   **`images/`**: Sub-directory for image files.
    -   `banner.jpg`: Image used for the banner component.
    -   `logo.png`: The logo for the website.
    -   Product images (e.g., `product1.jpg`, `product2.jpg`, etc.): Images for the various products displayed.

### `build/` Directory
This directory contains the optimized static assets generated after running the `npm run build` command. These are the files that get deployed to a web server for production.
-   **`static/`**: Contains subdirectories for JavaScript (`js`), CSS (`css`), and media files.
    -   **`js/main.[hash].js`**: The main bundled and minified JavaScript file for the application.
    -   **`js/main.[hash].js.LICENSE.txt`**: Contains license information for the JavaScript libraries included in the main bundle.
-   **`index.html`**: The production version of the main HTML file, with script and style tags injected.
-   Other assets like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, etc., copied from the `public` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Boshan-2-
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server
To start the application in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Building for Production
To create an optimized build of the application for deployment:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

-   `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
-   `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project. This is a one-way operation.
-   `npm run tailwind:init`: Initializes Tailwind CSS configuration (if not already done).
